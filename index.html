            How to play: <br>
            The goal of this game is to gather the most powerful weapon and to win against the other player in the battle.<br>
            The players start with a strength of 25 and this strength is increased by gathering weapons on board:<br>
            Star: +3 strength, Cake: +5 strength, Bread: +7 strength, Laser: +10 strength.<br>
            Use the arrow keys to control the first player (the guy) and to gather weapons on board.<br> 
            Now you can use WASD keys to control the second player (the girl) and to gather weapons on board.<br> 
            Then press T button to change the turn or after moving 120 px the player can not move towards.<br>
            If the two players are near then the battle starts. <br>
            In the battle it will be shown the weapons choosed by the players and then the players can start the battle.<br>
            Then the interface is very simple and the players in turns can use attacks, spells or holy shields.<br>
            Remember that at anytime you can pause the game by pressing P button.<br>
            Have fun and play good!
