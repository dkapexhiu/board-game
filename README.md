# Board Game

A simple board game to play in turns where players play in turns and when they are near the battle starts in turns

# How to play

Use the arrow keys to control the first player (the guy) and to gather weapons on board.  Now you can use WASD keys to control the second player (the girl) and to gather weapons on board. Then press T button to change the turn or after moving 120 px the player can not move towards.

If the two players are near then the battle starts. In the battle it will be shown the weapons choosed by the players and then the players can start the battle. Then the interface is very simple and the players in turns can use attacks, spells or holy shields.
